# Group-Messenger-in-Android
This is a simple Group Messenger build on Android which handles failures on one or more emulators 
- Created an Android App to implement a Group Messenger App by using ISIS Algorithm for message ordering.
- Using Socket Programming, Client-Server connection is established to transmit messages to all the phones.
- Using a Distributed Hash Table among 5 emulators in Android to store messages in a Distributed fashion in SQLite DB.
- This allowed for message recovery in case of failures.
